# Test Driven Interactions with CGPT prototype

This is a prototype for a more comprehensive flow of building software function-by-function via code-guided interactions with CGPT.

It can be visited at [jcwilk.github.io/tdi](https://jcwilk.github.io/tdi) - It requires your GPT api key which it stores in LocalStorage. Use at your own risk.

## How to run

`npm run dev` - run dev server

If you'd like to build under prod mode to test locally:

`npm run build` - build for prod

But this shouldn't be necessary since you can just use Pages!
