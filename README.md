# Tree Driven Interactions with GPT prototype

This is a Pages-only SPA prototype for a more comprehensive flow of building software function-by-function via code-guided interactions with GPT.

It can be visited at [jcwilk.github.io/tdi](https://jcwilk.github.io/tdi) - It requires your GPT api key which it stores in LocalStorage. Use at your own risk.

## TDI Legacy

If you're looking for or are curious about the history of this project, or are interested in a workflow/step/test oriented interface rather than a more open-ended chat
interface, then go over and check out [github.com/jcwilk/tdi_legacy] formerly called "Test Driven Interactions". There's a gif there illustrating how it works and is also
running as a freely available Github Pages site.

## How to run

`npm run dev` - run dev server

If you'd like to build under prod mode to test locally:

`npm run build` - build for prod

But this shouldn't be necessary since you can just use Pages!
